# Project 1

First project consists in implementing the RRT algorithm for solving a path searching problem from
a start to a goal position in some provided maps. Moreover, other two variations of this method
are developed, RRT-connect and RRT*, and all the results are compared along with A* algorithm
in terms of computational load, time and quality of the solution.

# Project 2

The aim of the second project is to map a specific environment in Gazebo (turtlebot3 house)
using the turtlebot3 waffle pi, then compute the optimal trajectory between a starting position
and a final position, and finally develop a feedback control logic to make the robot follow that
path.
